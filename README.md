context
=======

- Taking a news article that the user provides
  - Understanding the information behind that article
    - Using methods to find the item that is of the highest probability
  - Giving contextual background on that particular topic using certain sources
    - Contextual background could be: A timeline, news articles that relate, and definitions of words that are important
  - Good UI that takes an article, and displays it in a nice way with all this contextual information.

- Second build ontop:
  - Taking a term, and giving you context on that term.

- We can build initial term base by scraping articles, and seeing things that are relevent.
