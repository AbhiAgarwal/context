//@PURPOSE: Provide a time point with respect to an epoch
//
//@CLASSES:
// blpapi::TimePoint: a fixed moment in a linear model of time
// blpapi::TimePointUtil: namespace for &#39;TimePoint&#39; Utility functions
//
//@SEE_ALSO: blpapi_highresolutionclock, blpapi_datetime
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component provides a representation of a fixed moment in
// a strict linear model of time. A function to measure the distance between
// two such moments is provided. Note that such a moment is not associated
// with any particular calendar or wall-clock conventions---see
// &#39;blpapi_datetime&#39; for such representations (and for functions to apply such
// conventions to an existing time point).

struct blpapi_TimePoint {
    // This struct provides an *in-core* *value* *semantic* type for
    // representing a single moment in time, assuming a simple linear model of
    // time. The precision of such representations is guaranteed to be at
    // least at the granularity of nanoseconds, but only times relatively near
    // (within a few years of) the current moment are guaranteed to be
    // representable. The actual implementation of a time point is
    // implementation-defined and opaque to client code; in particular, time
    // points can *not* be transferred between processes. (The SDK reserves
    // the right to alter the epoch used as a base from run to run.) Clients
    // wishing to persist time points should use the
    // &#39;TimePointUtil::nanosecondsBetween&#39; function to measure distance from a
    // known epoch value, or convert the time point to some standard calendar
    // and wall-clock convention (e.g. &#39;blpapi::Datetime&#39;).
